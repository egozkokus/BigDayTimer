# Extension Icons

This folder contains the icon files for the BigDayTimer Chrome extension.

## Required Icons
According to the manifest.json, the following icons are needed:

1. **icon16.png** - 16x16px - Used in the extension's toolbar and context menus
2. **icon48.png** - 48x48px - Used in the Extensions management page
3. **icon128.png** - 128x128px - Used during installation and in the Chrome Web Store

## Design Guidelines
- Use a consistent color scheme and design language
- The icon should be recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using the timer/countdown theme (‚è≥, clock, or calendar elements)
- Follow Chrome's icon design best practices
- Use a transparent background for proper integration

## Color Scheme Suggestions
Based on the project's Hebrew interface and wedding/event theme:
- Primary: Blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) - matches the popup design
- Accent: Gold/yellow for premium features
- Text: White or dark blue for contrast

## Icon Ideas
- Clock/timer symbol with decorative elements
- Calendar with countdown numbers
- Hourglass with event-themed decorations
- Wedding rings with timer elements
- Heart with countdown display

## File Formats
- PNG format for all icon sizes
- Transparent background
- High quality with proper anti-aliasing
- Optimized file sizes

## Implementation Note
Currently, placeholder icon files are referenced in manifest.json but not yet created. These should be designed and added to enable proper Chrome extension functionality.
